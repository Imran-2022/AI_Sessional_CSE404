/*

a. Define simple facts about relationships (e.g., family relations, food preferences) and write queries to test them.
b. Create rules to define more complex relationships based on existing facts.
c. Implement predicates for basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication.
d. Experiment with backtracking and the cut operator (!) to control program flow and improve efficiency.
e. Write recursive predicates to solve problems: Calculating factorial, and Finding the nth Fibonacci number
f. Design and implement a basic AI-powered medical diagnosis system using Prolog. The system should identify common illnesses by analyzing symptoms and offer appropriate treatment suggestions.
g. Create a basic natural language parser in Prolog capable of handling simple declarative sentences with subjects, verbs, and objects
